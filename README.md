# Pokemon-Battle-Simulator
Our project implements a Pokemon Battle. The program takes in input from the
terminal, allowing the user to choose which Pokemon move they want to choose
and then the output is printed to the terminal and displayed in StdDraw. To do
this we implemented the Move and Pokemon java classes which create both Move
and Pokemon objects, the Combat class which includes helper functions, and the
Battle class which runs the Battle.
